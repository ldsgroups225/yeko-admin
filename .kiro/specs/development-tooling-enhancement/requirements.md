# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing Next.js project with comprehensive development tooling including Storybook for UI development, AI-powered code reviews, enhanced error monitoring, logging management, visual regression testing, SEO optimization, and automated dependency management. The goal is to create a complete development ecosystem that maximizes code quality, developer experience, and application performance.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Storybook Integration for UI Development

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use Storybook for isolated component development and documentation, so that I can build and test UI components independently and maintain a living style guide.

2. WHEN components are created THEN they SHALL have corresponding Storybook stories
3. WHEN Storybook is launched THEN it SHALL display all UI components with interactive controls
4. WHEN stories are written THEN they SHALL include accessibility testing with @storybook/addon-a11y
5. WHEN components are documented THEN they SHALL include comprehensive documentation using @storybook/addon-docs

### Requirement 2: Enhanced Code Review Process

**User Story:** As a development team, I want AI-powered code reviews with CodeRabbit to automatically identify issues and provide suggestions, so that code quality is maintained consistently across all pull requests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a pull request is created THEN CodeRabbit SHALL automatically review the code
2. WHEN TypeScript or React code is submitted THEN CodeRabbit SHALL check for best practices compliance
3. WHEN code review is completed THEN CodeRabbit SHALL provide actionable feedback and suggestions
4. WHEN draft PRs are created THEN CodeRabbit SHALL skip automatic review
5. WHEN WIP or DO NOT MERGE keywords are in PR titles THEN CodeRabbit SHALL ignore the review

### Requirement 3: Enhanced Error Monitoring and Logging

**User Story:** As a developer and operations team, I want comprehensive error monitoring with Sentry and centralized log management with Better Stack, so that I can quickly identify, diagnose, and resolve issues in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur in production THEN Sentry SHALL capture and report them with full context
2. WHEN errors occur in development THEN Sentry Spotlight SHALL provide local debugging capabilities
3. WHEN application logs are generated THEN LogTape SHALL format and structure them properly
4. WHEN logs need to be managed THEN Better Stack SHALL provide centralized log aggregation and analysis
5. WHEN performance issues occur THEN monitoring SHALL capture relevant metrics and traces

### Requirement 4: Lint-staged Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want linters to run only on staged files during commits, so that the commit process is fast and only modified code is validated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN files are staged for commit THEN lint-staged SHALL run appropriate linters on those files only
2. WHEN linting fixes are applied THEN the fixed files SHALL be automatically re-staged
3. WHEN linting fails THEN the commit SHALL be blocked until issues are resolved
4. WHEN different file types are staged THEN appropriate tools SHALL run for each file type
5. WHEN the pre-commit hook runs THEN it SHALL integrate with the existing Lefthook configuration

### Requirement 5: Commitizen Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want guided commit message creation with Commitizen, so that all commit messages follow conventional commit standards consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating commits THEN Commitizen SHALL provide an interactive prompt for message creation
2. WHEN commit messages are created THEN they SHALL follow conventional commit format
3. WHEN commit types are selected THEN appropriate scopes and descriptions SHALL be suggested
4. WHEN commits are made THEN they SHALL pass Commitlint validation automatically
5. WHEN the commit process is initiated THEN developers SHALL have a consistent, guided experience

### Requirement 6: Visual Regression Testing

**User Story:** As a QA engineer and developer, I want visual regression testing to automatically detect UI changes, so that unintended visual changes are caught before reaching production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN UI components change THEN visual regression tests SHALL capture and compare screenshots
2. WHEN visual differences are detected THEN the tests SHALL fail and highlight the changes
3. WHEN tests run in CI THEN visual comparisons SHALL be performed against baseline images
4. WHEN visual changes are intentional THEN baselines SHALL be easily updatable
5. WHEN Storybook stories exist THEN they SHALL be included in visual regression testing

### Requirement 7: SEO and Metadata Optimization

**User Story:** As a content manager and developer, I want comprehensive SEO metadata, JSON-LD structured data, and Open Graph tags, so that the application has optimal search engine visibility and social media sharing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pages are created THEN they SHALL include appropriate meta tags for SEO
2. WHEN content is structured THEN JSON-LD structured data SHALL be included
3. WHEN pages are shared on social media THEN Open Graph tags SHALL provide rich previews
4. WHEN the site is crawled THEN sitemap.xml SHALL be automatically generated and updated
5. WHEN search engines access the site THEN robots.txt SHALL provide appropriate crawling instructions

### Requirement 8: Automated Dependency Management

**User Story:** As a development team, I want automated dependency updates with Dependabot, so that security vulnerabilities are addressed promptly and dependencies stay current.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dependencies have updates available THEN Dependabot SHALL create pull requests automatically
2. WHEN security vulnerabilities are found THEN high-priority updates SHALL be created immediately
3. WHEN dependency updates are created THEN they SHALL include changelog information
4. WHEN updates are tested THEN CI SHALL run all tests before merging
5. WHEN updates are compatible THEN they SHALL be configured for automatic merging where appropriate

### Requirement 9: Lighthouse Score Optimization

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want to maximize Lighthouse scores across all metrics, so that the application provides optimal user experience and search engine ranking.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performance audits run THEN Lighthouse scores SHALL be maximized for Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, and SEO
2. WHEN images are used THEN they SHALL be optimized for web delivery
3. WHEN JavaScript is loaded THEN it SHALL be optimized for minimal blocking time
4. WHEN accessibility features are implemented THEN they SHALL meet WCAG guidelines
5. WHEN the application is audited THEN it SHALL achieve scores of 90+ in all Lighthouse categories

### Requirement 10: GitHub Actions Integration

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want comprehensive GitHub Actions workflows that run tests on pull requests, so that code quality is maintained and deployments are reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pull requests are created THEN GitHub Actions SHALL run all test suites automatically
2. WHEN tests pass THEN the PR SHALL be marked as ready for review
3. WHEN tests fail THEN the PR SHALL be blocked from merging
4. WHEN code coverage is generated THEN it SHALL be reported to Codecov
